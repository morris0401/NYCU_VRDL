## Introduction
This assignment focuses on the task of instance segmentation in colored medical images. The dataset contains colored medical images with instances of 4 different types of cells (class1, class2, class3, and class4). The dataset consists of 209 images for training and validation and 101 images for testing. The raw images and masks are provided in .tif format, requiring data processing for model training and evaluation.
The primary goal of this assignment is to train instance segmentation models to predict the segmentation masks for each instance of the target cells. Predicted masks need to be converted into a specific submission format.
For this task, we are required to develop a model based on Mask R-CNN [1]. The model should typically comprise key components: (1) The backbone responsible for extracting feature maps from the input images. (2) The Region Proposal Network (RPN) [3] to generate regions of interest that potentially contain objects. (3) The heads, which extend the object detection heads of Faster R-CNN [2] to predict the bounding box, class, and importantly, a segmentation mask for each proposed region. Pretrained weights, specifically from ImageNet [3], are permitted. A key constraint for this assignment is that the total number of trainable parameters in the model must be less than 200 million.
